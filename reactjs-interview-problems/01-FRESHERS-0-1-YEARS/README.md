## 💡 Tips for Freshers

### Before Starting:
1. **Master JavaScript first** - React is JavaScript
2. **Set up your environment** properly (Node.js, VS Code)
3. **Create a learning schedule** and stick to it
4. **Join React communities** (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow)
5. **Follow React docs** - they're excellent

### While Solving:
1. **Read problem 2-3 times** before coding
2. **Try for at least 30 minutes** before looking at solution
3. **Type code yourself** - don't copy-paste
4. **Understand WHY**, not just WHAT
5. **Test your code** with different scenarios
6. **Debug errors yourself** first

### After Solving:
1. **Compare with solution** and understand differences
2. **Note down key concepts** in your own words
3. **Explain solution out loud** (Feynman technique)
4. **Try variations** of the problem
5. **Review after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month**
