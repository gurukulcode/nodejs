## 💡 Tips for Freshers

### Before Starting:
1. **Set up your environment** properly (Node.js, VS Code, Git)
2. **Create a learning schedule** and stick to it
3. **Prepare a notebook** to document learnings
4. **Join Node.js communities** for support

### While Solving:
1. **Read the problem carefully** 2-3 times
2. **Understand requirements** before coding
3. **Try solving on your own** first (at least 30 minutes)
4. **Run and test** your code with different inputs
5. **Compare with solution** and understand differences
6. **Type the code yourself**, don't copy-paste

### After Solving:
1. **Explain the solution** to someone (or to yourself out loud)
2. **Note down key concepts** and patterns
3. **Try variations** of the problem
4. **Review after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month** (spaced repetition)
